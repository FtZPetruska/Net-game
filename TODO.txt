A bunch of things that could be done:
X Rewrite game_rand.c, the original code was provided by the teachers for us to generate boards easily, it saddly cannot be shared as-is and must be rewritten from scratch
    - Add documentation to game_rand
- Clean the code, it's been written before any of the original writers had heard about the book called "Clean code"
    - 02/03/2020 Big rewrite of the game.c file done, passes all tests and generates no warnings
- Comment the code, for the same reason as above, actual meaningful (and working) doxygen could be very useful
X Format the code, preferably set up a clean .clang-format
X Make the CMakeList more portable, by adding options for CLang, MSVC, right now it pretty much only works on GCC
- Fix the warnings, (bonus point if -Wextra is enabled)
    - 18/02/2020 Mostly done, only solver left
- Improve stability of the smart solver on larger boards
- Restore the Android compilation features, it had to be removed because it was too dependent on the University's environment to be of any use. (Docker ?)
- Port it to whatever you want!
- Find another background music, the original one was copyrighted, so this original commit comes with a similar music that is under CC BY 3.0
- Add more tests for game. 
- Add tests for game_io and game_rand. 
    Ideas: 
        - game_io -> save/load a standard game and check its attributes
        - game_rand -> generate X game board and check if they all correspond to what was asked
- Finish cell tests
- Overhaul game_io to ensure more safety and save the initial directions (currently lost on save).
    Ideas:
        - On save, first save all the current directions, then restart the game to get the initial directions
        - On load, create the game object with the initial directions then set each piece to what the current direction was on save
- Clean up all the header include
- Clean up cell header and file (It has been straight up exported from game so most functions are in header)
