A bunch of things that could be done:
X Rewrite game_rand.c, the original code was provided by the teachers for us to generate boards easily, it saddly cannot be shared as-is and must be rewritten from scratch
    - Add documentation to game_rand
- Clean the code, it's been written before any of the original writers had heard about the book called "Clean code"
- Comment the code, for the same reason as above, actual meaningful (and working) doxygen could be very useful
X Format the code, preferably set up a clean .clang-format
- Make the CMakeList more portable, by adding options for CLang, MSVC, right now it pretty much only works on GCC
- Fix the warnings, (bonus point if -Wextra is enabled)
- Restore the Android compilation features, it had to be removed because it was too dependent on the University's environment to be of any use. (Docker ?)
- Port it to whatever you want!
- Find another background music, the original one was copyrighted, so this original commit comes with a similar music that is under CC BY 3.0
